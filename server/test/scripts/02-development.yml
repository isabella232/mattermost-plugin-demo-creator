          There have been two separate reports by customers of broken file uploads.  I haven’t been able to reproduce, but I think we need to check into this ASAP to make sure there is not something that was introduced in this last release.

              Ok, I was able to reproduce and here is what I found:

              Issue is a regression- it was not an issue in the previous release. Here are the files I tested with:

               |       Attachment File Type  | Pass or Fail |
               |       :----------------------------- |:---------------:|

              Which dev worked last on this area?  Can they pinpoint where this issue was introduced?

              Thank you so much for your quick response @llloyd.  @sbowen, I think you were working on this feature?  I have created a ticket to track the work.

      Yes, bummer.  That is something I worked on.  I will get a PR submitted for a fix in the next hour or so.

      Great.  I think we will need to put out a dot release.  This is a core area of the app that could be really frustrustating for a lot of users if we don’t address right away.

          Looks good.  Wondering about your logic here, but I can queue for our developer’s conversation later in the week.

          ``` go

          export function trimFilename(filename) {

          let trimmedFilename = filename;

          if (filename.length > Constants.MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH) {

          trimmedFilename = filename.substring(0, Math.min(Constants.MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH, filename.length)) + '...';

          }

          return trimmedFilename;

          } ```

      ### Dot Release

      @channel Here is the checklist for this dot release.  Let me know when you have your items addressed:

      1. Release Manager:
       - Once the list of bugs to be fixed is finalized, post this checklist in Release Checklist channel
       - Notify customer success about upcoming dot release
      2. Dev:
       - PRs for hotfixes are made to release branch
       - Review PRs made from release branch and merge changes into the release branch as required and merge the release branch back into master once per day
      3. DevOps
       - Verify with Release Manager before cutting any new dot release RCs (approved fixes should be merged)
      4. QA:
       - Test the new release cut to verify fixes merged to the release branch work
       - Post in Release Discussion channel after testing
      5. Marketing:
       - Prepare blog post for mattermost.com and Twitter announcement, and send to PM to review.
