priority: 4
description: >
  **Description:** The initialization channel features logs for the set up of this demo instance environment.  A high availability cluster enables a Mattermost system to maintain service during outages and hardware failures through the use of redundant infrastructure. Failure of any one of these components does not interrupt operation of the system.
  For large scale deployments, a hardware proxy with dedicated devices for processing SSL encryption and decryption are recommended.  In a high availability configuration the proxy balances network load across multiple Mattermost servers.

  **Audience:** Network Administration, InfoSec         **Length:** 2 minutes
