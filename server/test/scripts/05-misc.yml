    I'm trying to catch up on the Marvel series, but the last one I saw was Iron Man and I have no idea which ones to see next. Recommendations?

      If you enjoy watching extraterrestrial stories, I'd recommend watching of Guardians of the Galaxy. It's story circle around Peter Quill who forms an uneasy alliance with a group of extraterrestrial misfits who are fleeing after stealing a powerful artifact.

      Thanks for the recommendation! That's the movie with the "tree character", right? Vin Diesel plays his voice?

    Groot!  Yes the first one has big groot, but the 2nd Guardians has Baby Groot & Teenager Groot at the end.  Best character in both movies!

    I feel like I'm missing some backstory here. Iron Man -> outer space? How did that happen? Or is this movie an anomaly in the Marvel universe?

      Hmmm, it made me think of it as well. My quick search tells me that back in the days, it's initially about super-guerillas fighting against Russians and Chinese who had taken over the USA, and then later on the author decided to change it into interplanetary situation.
      It's unusual setting for Marvels, though.
