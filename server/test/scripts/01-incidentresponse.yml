            value: Time is crucial when responding to issues such as security intrusions. Bots alert relevant team members when exceptions are detected. Mattermost allows teams to track resolution steps and keep everyone informed, which shortens resolution times by many critical minutes.

          This is an odd one. Seems Selena has been a target a few times this month. I’ve checked the proxy logs and confirmed that she didn’t open the URL, so we are good to just block the domain in the proxy and mail filter.

          This could be part of an ongoing scheme. I’ve found references to that domain on various analysis websites for phishing schemes.

      Looks similar to a phishing email received recently by Steve from Finance.

          Yes good idea - I will distribute and follow up with managers to make sure they review the procedures with their teams.
