      This is an odd one. Seems Selena has been a target a few times this month. I’ve checked the proxy logs and confirmed that she didn’t open the URL, so we are good to just block the domain in the proxy and mail filter.

      This could be part of an ongoing scheme. I’ve found references to that domain on various analysis websites for phishing schemes.

      Yes good idea - I will distribute and follow up with managers to make sure they review the procedures with their teams.
