      - Review PRs made from release branch and merge changes into the release branch as required and merge the release branch back into master once per day\
      3. DevOps\
      - Verify with Release Manager before cutting any new dot release RCs (approved fixes should be merged)\
      4. QA:\

        Hmmm, it made me think of it as well. My quick search tells me that back in the days, it's initially about super-guerillas fighting against Russians and Chinese who had taken over the USA, and then later on the author decided to change it into interplanetary situation.\
        It's unusual setting for Marvels, though.\

      # A Quick Guide to Mattermost Navigation\
\
      ## Channels \
      TownSquare is a public channel that all users have access to. This channel can be made \'93read-only\'94 so that important announcements can be posted by System Administrators for all team members to see.  All users are also defaulted into the Off-Topic channel.  Additionally, you can configure other default channels if desired.  \
\
      ## Posts, Replies and Reactions\
      Looking at the channel itself, you can see posts in the center. Scroll up to see earlier posts.  Each post has a little menu on the far right of the text allowing you to reply and react to the message as well.  Replying will open a window on the right hand side and reacting will apply an emoji under the post message.  You can reply from directly in the center channel or the right-hand side bar.  \
\
      Enter text and hit enter to post a message. Messages can be composed using markdown formatting to make the information stand out more or easier to read if posting code or by using a table. \
\
      ## Channel Header\
      The top of the channel, the channel header, features the channel name, a description for what the channel is about and a drop down for taking more action within the channel. \
\
      ## Channel Members\
      To the right of the channel header, you will see an icon representing channel members. Clicking on it shows you who is also in the channel. If you have permissions, you can also add and remove members from this menu. \
\
      ## Searching\
      You can also search messages pinned for all to reference within the channel, search for content, view recent mentions with your name, and view messages that you have flagged for easier.  \
\
      ## Channel and Team organization\
      Looking to the left of the center, you see that the left-hand area is made up of channels and direct messages. Channels can be public or private.  Direct messages can feature 1-1 discussion or group messages. To create channels use the \'93+\'94.  To  find channels, use the \'93More\'85\'94 button.  Further to the left, you will see multiple teams if you are a member of more than one.   \
\
      ## Main Menu\
      Above the Channels, you are able to access the Main Menu in the hamburger dropdown. From your account settings you can manage your profile, customize your UI and set preferences for being notified in application or on your mobile devices. Depending on your permissions, you may have other options from this menu that allows you to manage teams, integrations and even the system (if you are a System Admin). \
