    (inbound webhooks can be used to simulate users with name, profile pic and content of messages)
    where a security incident is flagged and InfoSec and DevOps teams respond with analysis and a solution.

      Received the notification on my cell phone and I am online reviewing our logs.
      Looks like we have a DDoS type of issue here.  I am seeing a large number of HTTP requests flooding the system.
      We are well over our HTTP threshold, which is what triggered this alarm.
